# Why We Chose Svelte

Svelte offers the same functionalities as other frontend frameworks but adopts a simpler and more efficient approach, directly integrated into HTML.

## Pros

### Near Zero Boilerplate

- **Faster Development**: Svelte's minimal boilerplate allows for faster development cycles.
- **Ease of Use**: The straightforward syntax makes it easier for new developers to get started.

### SvelteKit

- **Advanced Features**: SvelteKit follows the same philosophy as Svelte and provides advanced features with minimal configuration.
- **Seamless Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with Svelte, offering a cohesive development experience.

### Easier State Sharing

- **Simplified State Management**: Sharing state between components is more straightforward in Svelte.
- **Reactive Variables**: Variables are reactive by default, reducing the need for explicit state management.

### Performance

- **No Virtual DOM**: Svelte does not use a Virtual DOM, leading to better performance.
- **Maintainable Code**: The concise and reactive nature of Svelte code makes it more maintainable and easier to collaborate on.

## Cons

### Smaller Ecosystem

- **Recent Framework**: Svelte is more recent than some other frameworks, resulting in a smaller ecosystem.
- **Community and Resources**: While growing, the community and available resources are not as extensive as those for more established frameworks.

## Conclusion

While Svelte is a newer framework and has a smaller ecosystem compared to more established options, it offers numerous advantages that make it a compelling choice. Its intuitive syntax, faster development cycles, and superior state management make it a strong contender in the frontend framework landscape. Additionally, the performance benefits and ease of collaboration further solidify Svelte as a top choice for modern web development.
